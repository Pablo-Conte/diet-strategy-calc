# Cutting Macro Calculator (Personal Project)

This is a personal project built to help me calculate my daily nutritional needs during a **cutting** phase â€” where the goal is to **preserve muscle mass** while reducing body fat.

The script was created specifically for **my own use**, based on my age, weight, height, and activity level, and includes formulas for:

- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** using:
  - Harris-Benedict Equation
  - FAO/WHO Equation
  - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** with activity multiplier
- Macronutrient targets based on body weight:
  - **Protein**: 2g per kg
  - **Fat**: 1g per kg
  - **Carbohydrates**: 2g per kg (adjusted during the cutting phase)

> ğŸ§  **Note**: This is a personal tool and not intended for general use. Values and formulas are tailored to my own routine and goals.
